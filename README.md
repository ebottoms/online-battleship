# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Example

This is a simple Battleship game implemented using Python and sockets.

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `server.py` script.
2. **Connect clients:** Run the `client.py` script on two different machines or terminals.
3. **Play the game:** Players each have a 10x10 tile board on which to set up their battleships. Once their ships are set up, they must guess where the other player's ships are on their board and fire torpedos to hit them. Each player takes a turn firing a torpedo. Once one player has hit every tile on which the enemy player's ships sit, they win! No draws!

**Technologies used:**
